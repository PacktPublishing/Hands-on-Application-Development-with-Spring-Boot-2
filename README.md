## About the Video Course
Spring Boot is the fastest way to get a Spring application up and running with the fewest lines of code and the least configuration. It aims to make development easy so you can create production-grade applications and services. The Spring framework provides a great toolkit for the development of complex applications. In this course, we’ll fully leverage Spring Boot’s capabilities to create a payment system application and secure it with Spring Security.

This course provides a hands-on approach to building a payment system application from scratch using Spring Boot 2.0. You’ll begin by setting up Spring Boot together with Spring’s most powerful feature: Dependency Injection. Then you’ll build a data access layer with Spring data and rework it to be highly performant using Spring data reactive. Next, you’ll learn about Spring rest and servlets and use it to expose resources via HTTP endpoints. 
Later you’ll use Spring MVC to build an interface for the payment system. Moving on, you’ll expose critical business metrics using MicroMeter library and Spring actuator with Prometheus library. Finally, you’ll package your application into a Docker container and deploy your application into the cloud.
